---------
This is a JRPG-styled music resource pack that requires Obscuria's Maestro mod to function. 
Currently, there is music for the title screen, rain, and forest biomes. I will be updating in a few days to include more scenarios, and will include a more detailed description.

This music pack is being created to go with my WIP Modpack, Astraloria.

I recommend disabling vanilla music while using this pack, as it does not quite fit the theme. To do so, locate the Maestro config file (config/obscuria/maestro-client.toml) and make sure the config reads vanilla_enabled = false
